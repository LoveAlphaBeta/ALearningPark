**Attention, PLEASE:**  
- Please sync your code with a folder named after you or your nickname that we all can recognise.
- We have a C language code style manual at [here](https://github.com/LoveAlphaBeta/Lab_Documents/blob/master/C%20Programming%20Manual%20(Editing).markdown) but it is under *construction*.
- You could sync your code with a explain text file in type markdown (file like *.md or *.markdown). If you havn't the software you can get it at [here](https://atom.io/).
- We will give advises if neccesary in codes files like this, please be understood:
  ```
  int main(){
    printf("hello world") // 2017-04-28-2100@Admin: Missing ';'.
    /*  2017-04-28-2102@Admin:
        Add
          "return 0;"
        is better.
    */
  }

  // We use 'a' to express a character and "aaa" to express a string.
  // We could use string like
  // "yyyy-MM-dd-hhmm@Somebody" to
  // express the date and person
  // who gave the advise and the date of the advise.
  // Any advise could **NOT** influence the compile of the original code.
  ```
- We have a demo in this repository called demo, please do ***NOT*** modify it any way.
